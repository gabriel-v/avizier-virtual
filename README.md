# avizier-virtual

## Running

        docker swarm init
        docker stack deploy -c stack.yml avizier

## How this happened

I lost my homework and now I have to write it all over again. My backup server
has been down for over three months now. I vaguely remember the cloudy night
when I tried to downgrade Debian from testing to stable.


## The web service

The initial setup was inspired from [this blog post](http://pawamoy.github.io/2018/02/01/docker-compose-django-postgres-nginx.html).
